# FizzBuzz

Challenge:
=========
Based on the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&list=WL&index=1&t=87s) by Tom Scott, I decided to give the FizzBuzz interview challenge a go. On committing this, I have not seen the rest of the video where he said to "pause" it. I have also not seen other people attempts and have only searched to find the "resulting values" to compare my solutions answer with someone elses for testing.


Update:
=======
After watching the rest of the video, I'm proud to say that my solution was almost exactly the same as Tom Scotts. While it could be improved slightly (like all forms of programming), for the sake of the challenge I'm pretty happy with it.

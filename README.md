# FizzBuzz

Challenge:
=========
Based on the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&list=WL&index=1&t=87s) by Tom Scott, I decided to give the FizzBuzz interview challenge a go. On committing this, I have not seen the rest of the video where he said to "pause" it. I have also not seen other people attempts and have only searched to find the "resulting values" to compare my solutions answer with someone elses for testing.
